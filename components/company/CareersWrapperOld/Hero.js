          Good Party is a fully-funded startup organized as a Public Benefit
          Corporation (people and impact over revenues or profit). Our team is
          100% remote, with diverse backgrounds and political beliefs. We work
          hard on our mission of making people matter more than money in our
          democracy, but care about our own well being too.
          <br />
          <br />
          If creatively disrupting politics for good sounds like a challenge
          you’re up for, check out the roles we’re looking to fill right now!
